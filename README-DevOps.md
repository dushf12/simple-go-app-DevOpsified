Implementing DevOps for a Go Web Application

The aim of this project is to apply DevOps methodologies to a Go-based web application. This simple web application, built using Golang, utilizes the net/http package to handle HTTP requests.

Key DevOps practices incorporated in this project include:

Building a Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
Containerizing the application
Implementing Continuous Integration (CI)
Automating Continuous Deployment (CD)




## Creating Dockerfile (Multi-stage build)

The Dockerfile is essential for creating a Docker image containing the Go web application along with all its dependencies. Once the Docker image is built, it can be used to launch a Docker container.

A multi-stage build is used to streamline the image creation process. This feature of Docker allows us to separate the build stages, minimizing the final image size and enhancing security by excluding unnecessary files and dependencies.

## Containerization

Containerizing an application means packaging it together with all necessary dependencies into a container. This enables the application to run in a consistent environment, independent of the underlying system.

We leverage Docker to containerize the Go web application. Docker allows us to build, package, and run containers efficiently.

Commands to build the Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t <your-docker-username>/go-web-app .
```

Command to run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 <your-docker-username>/go-web-app
```

Command to push the Docker container to Docker Hub:

```bash
docker push <your-docker-username>/go-web-app
```

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) involves automating the process of merging code changes into a central repository. CI is essential for detecting bugs early and ensuring the code remains in a deployable state at all times.

For CI, GitHub Actions is employed. This tool automates workflows, including building, testing, and deploying applications.

The GitHub Actions pipeline for this project includes the following steps:

- Checkout the code
- Build the Docker image
- Run the Docker container
- Execute tests



## Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment (CD) focuses on automating the deployment of code changes to production environments. By reducing the time between code updates and deployment, CD allows for quicker delivery of new features and bug fixes to users.

Argo CD is used to facilitate CD for the Go web application. As a GitOps-based continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, Argo CD deploys applications to Kubernetes clusters directly from Git repositories, ensuring the deployment is always synchronized with the repository.

## Conclusion

This project integrates core DevOps practices such as Docker containerization, CI with GitHub Actions, and CD using Argo CD to automate and streamline the development and deployment of a Go web application.
